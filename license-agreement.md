# Licensing

Telerik JustMock offers commercial (JustMock) and free (JustMock Lite) versions. The commercial version also provides you with a **30-day trial** with a full-featured version of the tool — no restrictions! What’s more, you are eligible for complete technical support during your trial period in case you have any questions. To sign up for a free 30-day trial, go [here](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx).

* To use all the features provided by the commercial version of Telerik JustMock, you need to purchase a license. The terms of use are fully described in the [Telerik JustMock License Agreement](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-agreement/justmock-dlw-s).
