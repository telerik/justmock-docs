The commercial version also provides you with a **30-day trial** with a full-featured version of the tool - no restrictions! What's more, you are eligible for complete technical support during your trial period in case you have any questions. To sign up for a free 30-day trial, go [here](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx).
