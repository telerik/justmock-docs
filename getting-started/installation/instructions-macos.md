# Installation on macOS

This topic outlines how to install [Telerik JustMock](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx) on a macOS.

### Installing JustMock

1. Download the JustMock installer from www.telerik.com:
	* Keep in mind that this will require you to either log in or create a new Telerik account.
	* Note that there are separate installers for x64 and arm64 platforms. Choose the one corresponding to your device system architecture.

1. Run the installer and follow the steps.
