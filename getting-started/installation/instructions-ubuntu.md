# Installation on Ubuntu

This topic outlines how to install [Telerik JustMock](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx) on a Ubuntu.

### Download JustMock tar.gz Archive

1. Download the JustMock tar.gz archive from www.telerik.com:
	* Keep in mind that this will require you to either log in or create a new Telerik account.
	* Currently, there is an archive available only for the x64 platform. Please ensure that it is compatible with your system architecture.

1. Expand the contents of the archive to a specific local folder on your file system. Make sure to choose a location that is easily accessible for your future reference.
