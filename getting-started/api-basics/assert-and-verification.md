# Assert and Verification

While the .NET gives you convenient methods for asserting different conditions into your unit tests, it still doesnâ€™t cover some behaviors that can be set up when using **JustMock**. That is why, **JustMock** exposes several asserting methods to help you verify the behavior is what you expect.

When setting that a specific method must be called, or a set of methods should be called in a specific order, the actual execution must be then verified with the **`Mock.Assert`** method. To illustrate the exact usage, we will use the following setup: 

#### [C#] Sample setup

{{region justmock-getting-started-basics-assert_0}}

    public interface IWarehouse
    {
        bool HasInventory(string productName, int quantity);
     
        void Remove(string productName, int quantity);
    }
     
    public class Order
    {
        public Order(string productName, int quantity)
        {
            this.ProductName = productName;
            this.Quantity = quantity;
        }
     
        public string ProductName { get; private set; }
        public int Quantity { get; private set; }
        public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
     
        public void Complete(IWarehouse warehouse)
        {
            if (warehouse.HasInventory(this.ProductName, this.Quantity))
            {
                warehouse.Remove(this.ProductName, this.Quantity);
                this.IsCompleted = true;
            }
        }
    }
{{endregion}}


**Example 1** shows how you can set up a test verifying that the `Complete` method is first invoked, followed by `HasInventory` and `Remove` is last in the chain:

#### [C#] Example 1: Verify the order of invocation for several methods

{{region justmock-getting-started-basics-assert_1}}

    Order order = new Order("testProduct", 10);
    IWarehouse warehouse = Mock.Create<IWarehouse>();
     
    // Define that the Complete method should execute its original implementation
    // and should be invoked once in the order it appears in the arrange phase.
    Mock.Arrange(() => order.Complete(warehouse))
        .CallOriginal()
        .InOrder()
        .OccursOnce();
     
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.HasInventory(order.ProductName, order.Quantity))
        .Returns(true)
        .InOrder()
        .OccursOnce();
     
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.Remove(order.ProductName, order.Quantity))
        .DoNothing() // Skip the method logic.
        .InOrder() // Define that the method should be invoked in the order it appears in the Arrange phase.
        .OccursOnce(); // Define that there should be a single call to this method during the test execution.
     
    order.Complete(warehouse);
     
    // Assert that all the arranged methods of the two classes conform to the expectations set on them.
    Mock.Assert(warehouse); 
    Mock.Assert(order); 
{{endregion}}

>More information on how you can set up a specific occurrence of members is available in the [Asserting Occurrence]({%slug justmock/basic-usage/asserting-occurrence%}) topic.

In addition to the behavior of the class members, you can also assert a property setter.

#### [C#] Example 2: Verify property setter

{{region justmock-getting-started-basics-assert_1}}

    // Create a mock object that you can set up.
    // Using Behavior.CallOriginal ensures that all members that are not arranged will follow their original implementation.
    Order order = Mock.Create<Order>(Behavior.CallOriginal, "testProduct", 10);
    IWarehouse warehouse = Mock.Create<IWarehouse>();
     
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.HasInventory(order.ProductName, order.Quantity)).Returns(true);
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.Remove(order.ProductName, order.Quantity)).DoNothing();
                           
    // Define that the setter of the IsCompleted must be invoked at least once with value = true
    Mock.ArrangeSet(() => order.IsCompleted = true).MustBeCalled();
     
    order.Complete(warehouse);
     
    // Assert that the setter has been invoked
    Mock.AssertSet(() => order.IsCompleted = true);
{{endregion}}
