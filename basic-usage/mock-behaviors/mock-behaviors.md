# Mock Behaviors

This article provides a quick overview of the four mock behaviors in __TelerikÂ® JustMock__. For more details about each mock behavior, follow the links below.

__RecursiveLoose Behavior__

This is the default mock behavior. It takes care of members at all times by recursively creating empty stubs for them. Mocks with RecursiveLoose behavior will never return `null` on any of the mocks in the dependency chain even if none of them are arranged.

__Loose Behavior__

Unless otherwise arranged, the members of loose mocks act like stubs - they return the default value of their return type - null for reference types and the default value for value types.

__CallOriginal Behavior__

A mock with behavior CallOriginal will follow the original implementation of the mocked instance.

__Strict Behavior__

When a strict mock is created, you are only allowed to call arranged methods. Every other call will result in `MockException`.
