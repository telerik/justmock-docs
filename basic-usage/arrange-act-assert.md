# Arrange Act Assert

Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for arranging and formatting code in Unit Test methods.

It is a best practice to author your tests in more natural and convenient way. The idea is to develop a unit test by following these 3 simple steps:

* __Arrange__ – setup the testing objects and prepare the prerequisites for your test.
* __Act__ – perform the actual work of the test.
* __Assert__ – verify the result.


## Benefits of Using Arrange Act Assert

* Clearly separates what is being tested from the setup and verification steps.
* Clarifies and focuses attention on a historically successful and generally necessary set of test steps.
* Makes some test smells more obvious:
    * Assertions intermixed with "Act" code.
    * Test methods that try to test too many different things at once.

## Arrange/Act/Assert with JustMock

Lets illustrate the benefits of the pattern with an example. We will use a sample warehouse and a dependent order object. The warehouse holds inventories of different products. An order contains a product and quantity. 

The warehouse interface and the order class look like this:

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region QuickStart#SampleCS}}
    public delegate void ProductRemoveEventHandler(string productName, int quantity);

    public interface Iwarehouse
    {
        event ProductRemoveEventHandler ProductRemoved;

        string Manager { get; set; }

        bool HasInventory(string productName, int quantity);
        void Remove(string productName, int quantity);
    }

    public class Order
    {
        public Order(string productName, int quantity)
        {
            this.ProductName = productName;
            this.Quantity = quantity;
        }

        public string ProductName { get; private set; }
        public int Quantity { get; private set; }
        public bool IsFilled { get; private set; }

        public void Fill(Iwarehouse warehouse)
        {
            if (warehouse.HasInventory(this.ProductName, this.Quantity))
            {
                warehouse.Remove(this.ProductName, this.Quantity);
            }
        }

        public virtual string Receipt(DateTime orderDate)
        {
            return string.Format("Ordered {0} {1} on {2}", this.Quantity, this.ProductName, orderDate.ToString("d"));
        }
    }
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region QuickStart#SampleVB}}
    Public Delegate Sub ProductRemovedEventHandler(productName As String, quantity As Integer)

    Public Interface IWarehouse
        Event ProductRemoved As ProductRemovedEventHandler

        Property Manager() As String

        Function HasInventory(productName As String, quantity As Integer) As Boolean
        Sub Remove(productName As String, quantity As Integer)
    End Interface

    Public Class Order
        Public Sub New(productName As String, quantity As Integer)
            Me.ProductName = productName
            Me.Quantity = quantity
        End Sub

        Public Property ProductName() As String
            Get
                Return m_ProductName
            End Get
            Private Set(value As String)
                m_ProductName = value
            End Set
        End Property
        Private m_ProductName As String
        Public Property Quantity() As Integer
            Get
                Return m_Quantity
            End Get
            Private Set(value As Integer)
                m_Quantity = value
            End Set
        End Property
        Private m_Quantity As Integer
        Public Property IsFilled() As Boolean
            Get
                Return m_IsFilled
            End Get
            Private Set(value As Boolean)
                m_IsFilled = value
            End Set
        End Property
        Private m_IsFilled As Boolean

        Public Sub Fill(warehouse As IWarehouse)
            If warehouse.HasInventory(Me.ProductName, Me.Quantity) Then
                warehouse.Remove(Me.ProductName, Me.Quantity)
                IsFilled = True
            End If
        End Sub

        Public Overridable Function Receipt(orderDate As DateTime) As String
            Return String.Format("Ordered {0} {1} on {2}", Me.Quantity, Me.ProductName, orderDate.ToString("d"))
        End Function
    End Class
  {{endregion}}

## Arrange

First we need an order:

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    var order = new Order("Camera", 2);
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Dim order = New Order("Camera", 2)
  {{endregion}}

Now let’s mock the warehouse:

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    var warehouse = Mock.Create<IWarehouse>();
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Dim warehouse = Mock.Create(Of IWarehouse)()
  {{endregion}}

We want to ensure that when an order of 2 cameras is placed, the warehouse returns that it has enough quantity of the product.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.HasInventory("Camera", 2)).Returns(true);
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Arrange(Function() warehouse.HasInventory("Camera", 2)).Returns(true)
  {{endregion}}

>note You can also check the [Create Mocks By Example](./create-mocks-by-example) topic that demonstrates how you can arrange mock objects in more complex scenarios.

That’s it. We set up the testing objects for our test. Now let’s act.


## Act

Fill our order from the warehouse.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    order.Fill(warehouse);
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    order.Fill(warehouse)
  {{endregion}}

Once we have executed the desired action, we need to ensure that it has been completed successfully and our order was actually filled, meaning that the warehouse really had inventory of 2 cameras.

## Assert 

We will use the __Assert__ class from Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting namespace (found in Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework assembly – automatically added as a reference from Visual Studio while creating a Test Project) to ensure that the `IsFilled` property of the order is set to `true`.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    Assert.IsTrue(order.IsFilled);
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Assert.IsTrue(order.IsFilled)
  {{endregion}}

With this simple example we illustrated the use of the AAA pattern and showed how easy it is to test your code with JustMock. Notice that you don’t need to change even a single line of your original code to set up, execute and verify its correctness.

## Verify Interaction

Now let's take it a little further and verify not only the final result, but also the interaction while executing the test.

We arranged that when the warehouse’s `HasInventory` method is called with specific parameters, it should return `true`, but we never ensured that this method is actually called. Let's change the `Arrange` method and mark that `warehouse.HasInventory` must be called.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Arrange(() => warehouse.HasInventory("Camera", 2)).Returns(true).MustBeCalled();
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Arrange(Function() warehouse.HasInventory("Camera", 2)).Returns(true).MustBeCalled()
  {{endregion}}

To verify this we need to call `Mock.Assert` in the `Assert` phase with the warehouse object.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Assert(warehouse);
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region }}
    Mock.Assert(warehouse)
  {{endregion}}

## Verify Order of Calls

Furthermore you may want to ensure that a set of method calls are executed in a particular order. Let\`s assume we have the following `IFoo` interface:

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region BUAAA#IFooSUT}}
    public interface IFoo
    {
        void Submit();
        void Echo();
    }
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region BUAAA#IFooSUT}}
    Public Interface IFoo
        Sub Submit()
        Sub Echo()
    End Interface
  {{endregion}}

You use the `Arrange` method to define the methods invocation order.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder1}}
    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldVerifyCallsOrder()
    {
        // Arrange
        var foo = Mock.Create<IFoo>();

        Mock.Arrange(() => foo.Submit()).InOrder();
        Mock.Arrange(() => foo.Echo()).InOrder();

        // Act
        foo.Submit();
        foo.Echo();

        // Assert
        Mock.Assert(foo);
    }
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder1}}
    <TestMethod()>
    Public Sub ShouldVerifyCallsOrder()
        ' Arrange
        Dim foo = Mock.Create(Of IFoo)()

        Mock.Arrange(Sub() foo.Submit()).InOrder()
        Mock.Arrange(Sub() foo.Echo()).InOrder()

        ' Act
        foo.Submit()
        foo.Echo()

        ' Assert
        Mock.Assert(foo)
    End Sub
  {{endregion}}

Again to verify this we need to call `Mock.Assert` in the `Assert` phase with the foo object.

Note that the `InOrder` option also supports asserting the order of mock calls regardless of the instance within the test scope. Imagine that you have to validate that the user has logged in before using their shopping cart in your application.

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder2}}
    public interface IUserValidationService
    {
        int ValidateUser(string userName, string password);
    }

    public interface IShoppingCartService
    {
        IList<string> LoadCart(int userID);
    }
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder2}}
    Public Interface IUserValidationService
        Function ValidateUser(ByVal userName As String, ByVal password As String) As Integer
    End Interface

    Public Interface IShoppingCartService
        Function LoadCart(ByVal userID As Integer) As IList(Of String)
    End Interface
  {{endregion}}

Here we have defined the `IUserValidationService` and the `IShoppingCartService` services whose invocation order we are going to assert in the following test:

  #### __[C#]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder3}}
    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldAssertInOrderForDifferentInstancesInTestMethodScope()
    {
        string userName = "Bob";
        string password = "Password";
        int userID = 5;
        var cart = new List<string> {"Foo", "Bar"};

        // Arrange
        var userServiceMock = Mock.Create<IUserValidationService>();
        var shoppingCartServiceMock = Mock.Create<IShoppingCartService>();

        Mock.Arrange(() => userServiceMock.ValidateUser(userName, password)).Returns(userID).InOrder().OccursOnce();
        Mock.Arrange(() => shoppingCartServiceMock.LoadCart(userID)).Returns(cart).InOrder().OccursOnce();

        // Act
        userServiceMock.ValidateUser(userName, password);
        shoppingCartServiceMock.LoadCart(userID);

        // Assert
        Mock.Assert(userServiceMock);
        Mock.Assert(shoppingCartServiceMock);
    }
  {{endregion}}

  #### __[VB]__

  {{region BUAAA#VerifyInvocationOrder3}}
    <TestMethod()>
    Public Sub ShouldAssertInOrderForDifferentInstancesInTestMethodScope()
        Dim userName As String = "Bob"
        Dim password As String = "Password"
        Dim userID As Integer = 5
        Dim cart As IList(Of String) = {"Foo", "Bar"}

        ' Arrange
        Dim userServiceMock = Mock.Create(Of IUserValidationService)()
        Dim shoppingCartServiceMock = Mock.Create(Of IShoppingCartService)()

        Mock.Arrange(Function() userServiceMock.ValidateUser(userName, password)).Returns(userID).InOrder().OccursOnce()
        Mock.Arrange(Function() shoppingCartServiceMock.LoadCart(userID)).Returns(cart).InOrder().OccursOnce()

        ' Act
        userServiceMock.ValidateUser(userName, password)
        shoppingCartServiceMock.LoadCart(userID)

        ' Assert
        Mock.Assert(userServiceMock)
        Mock.Assert(shoppingCartServiceMock)
    End Sub
  {{endregion}}

In the arrange phase we defined that the `ValidateUser` call should be made only once and before the `LoadCart` service call. The `LoadCart` call should also occur only once and should follow the `ValidateUser` service call. We act and then assert our expectations.

>noteRefer to the [Asserting Occurrence](./asserting-occurrence) topic to learn more about asserting occurrence. The example also uses the [Returns](./mock/returns) option in order to ignore the actual call and return a custom value.
