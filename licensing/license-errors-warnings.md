# License Activation Errors and Warnings

Starting with the Q2 2025 release, Telerik JustMock will display specific warnings and errors if used without a valid license or with an invalid one. This article explains what defines an invalid license, the possible reasons behind it, and the related warnings and errors you might encounter.

## Invalid License

An invalid license can be caused by any of the following:

- Using an expired subscription licenseâ€”subscription licenses expire at the end of the subscription term.
- Using a perpetual license for product versions released outside the validity period of your license.
- Using an expired trial license.
- A missing license for Telerik JustMock.
- Not installing a license key in your application.
- Not updating the license key after renewing your Telerik JustMock license.

## License Warnings and Errors

When working on a project with Telerik JustMock and encountering an expired or missing license, the test execution will display the following errors:
