# Welcome to Telerik JustMock

Telerik JustMock is an easy to use mocking tool designed to help you create better unit tests, faster than ever. JustMock makes it easier for you to create mock objects and set expectations independently of external dependencies like databases, web service calls, or proprietary code.

The JustMock API is completely [AAA]({%slug justmock/basic-usage/arrange-act-assert%}) (Arrange/Act/Assert) oriented thus helping you keep your unit tests well structured, clean and readable. No matter whether you try to mock an interface, a sealed class or a static class, the pattern you use is the same.

## What Is Mocking and Why Do I Need It?
[Mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) is a concept in unit testing where real objects are substituted with fake objects that imitate the behavior of the real ones. Mocking is done so that a test can focus on the code being tested and not on the behavior or state of external dependencies. 

For example, if you have a data repository class that runs business logic and then saves information to a database, you want your unit test to focus on the business logic and not on the database. Mocking the “save” calls to your database ensures your tests run quickly and do not depend on the availability or state of your database. When you’re ready to make sure the “save” calls are working, then you’re moving on to *integration testing*. Unit tests should not cross system boundaries, but integration tests are allowed to cross boundaries and make sure everything works together (your code, your database, your web services, etc.).

## What Can Be Mocked?

Mock objects can be created and maintained manually, but this is a time consuming and ultimately unproductive approach. A tool like __Telerik JustMock__ allows you to focus on writing tests and forget about the mocking details. Mock objects are created automatically in memory when the tests run based on your simple configuration in the unit test. There are no “physical” mock objects that have to be maintained as your project changes.

JustMock allows you to mock everything from interfaces, virtual and abstract methods and properties to sealed classes, __non-virtual methods and properties__, __static classes, methods and properties__, even those from __mscorlib__ like __DateTime, File, FileInfo__, etc.
All these can be mocked without a single change of your production code.

### Final and Static Mocking

Unlike other mocking frameworks, JustMock lets you mock: 

*  Sealed classes: call methods of sealed classes even with internal constructors. 
*  Static classes, methods, properties: create mocks of static classes, set expectations for static method and property calls, verify static method calls. 
*  Final methods or properties: assert final methods, overloads, `out` and `ref` arguments.
